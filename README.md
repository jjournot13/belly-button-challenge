## Overview
The purpose of this project is to implement the skills learned and tools introduced in Module 14 to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Tools
- JavaScript
- HTML
- Plotly

## Project Structure
### Build Components for Interactive Dashboard
1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.
1. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
1. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
1. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
1. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
1. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.

In addition to referencing several class actvities and applicable documentation, I received assistance from AskBCS Learning Assistant with ensuring my code to populate the charts was working correctly.
